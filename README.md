# Fantasy Bank App. The financial app of the future. No more working for money!

This project is a demo app. It's a client side React app that interacts with an API. 
It has several public static pages and some functionality that is session protected.
- To use it, login using the default credentials hard coded in the login form or register and create your own account.
Once logged in, start by depositing some money using the ### `deposit` link in the Main Menu.
Then go to the Make MoneyTM link and make some money!!
- The Withdraw menu link does nothing besides showing a random error message. That is because you should not ever wihdraw your money from our app, so there is no funcionality built for that.

## Packages used so far:
- React with bootstrap for client UI
- Redux for session management
- Next for server side API
- MongoDB as server database
- JWT for user authetication. Next server API creates and signs tokens.
 
## Things I plan to do later:
- Next for server side rendering
- Integrate wih Firebase
- Build a web chat app for "customer Support" with sockets.io



## Latest Release:

- Added this file
- Added localstorage data encryption (better obfuscation)
