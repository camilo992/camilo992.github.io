# TAoke App. The app of the future. No more working for money!

This project is a demo app. It's a client side React app that interacts with an API. 
It has several public static pages and some functionality that is session protected.
To use it, login using the default credentials or register and create your own account.
Once logged in, start by depositing some money using the ### `deposit` link in the Main Menu.
Then go to the Make MoneyTM link and make some money!!
The Withdraw menu link does nothing besides showing a random error message. That is because you should not ever wihdraw your money from our app, so there is no funcionality built for that.

## Latest Release:

- Added this file
- Added localstorage data encryption (better obfuscation)
